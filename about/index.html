                <p>It was March 2020. I was enjoying my growing career as a professional musician, choir conductor. Suddenly all my rehearsals were cancelled and all my concerts &ldquo;rescheduled&rdquo;. I told myself &ldquo;Two or three month and I will be back to my music&rdquo;. In the meanwhile, what to do with this excess of free time?</p>
<p>I have always been comfortable around computers. I was four years old when my father bought the first one for his company. During high school, I also tryied out some &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; stuff&hellip; It was a lot of fun, but it was not my path, then.</p>
<p>March 2020, a lot of free time and not a big pressure to immediately go back earning money. What to do? I remembered my high school IT experiments and I planned a small challenge for myself: installing Linux. I figured quite quickly that in 2020 is not such a challenge anymore. Goodbye Win10, welcome PopOS!, Fedora, Linux MX, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>I watched many youtube tutorials and read blog articles which gave me the basic vocabulary and an overview on the current mainstream technologies. I discovered soon enough that old fashion books would be the next step in seeking a good education, until falling in love with&hellip; official documentation, the true source of knowledge.</p>
<p>I was a lot of fun studying and making experiments on my home lab made of Raspberry Pis, my gaming oriented workstation and cloud instances. I was acquiring knowledge and basic experience relatively easily. I started to ask myself the question: &ldquo;How much fun would it be to work in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; with these amazing technologies?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>During the summer I decided to get &ldquo;serious&rdquo; with it. I made a plan for the following few months. I draw a path for a basic education which would allow me to learn and practice the technologies I was passionate about and shape them with some professional coherency.</p>
<p>In three month I prepared and achieved the Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104) and the Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin (LFCS) while studying about containers (Docker), orchestrators (Ansible) and a scripting language (Python).</p>
<p>I published my <a href="%22https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrico-ruggieri-9390631b7/%22">linkedIn</a> profile and here I am, December 2020.</p>
