<p>It was March 2020. I was enjoying my growing career as a professional musician, choir conductor. Suddenly all my rehearsals were cancelled and all my concerts &ldquo;rescheduled&rdquo;. &ldquo;Two or three month and I will be back to my music&rdquo; I told myself. At that time I could not suspect that a new career was waiting for me.</p>
<p>March 2020, could not work and a lot of &ldquo;free&rdquo;. What about a challenge? Let&rsquo;s install Linux and use it as main desktop. I quickly figured that in 2020 it is not such a challenge but I world unknown to me was about to reveal itself.</p>
<p>In between YouTube video, blogs, articles, book, etc&hellip; I meet web applications, containers, orchestrators, devops, Python, cloud computing. In a home lab made of Raspberry Pis and virtual machines I made my experiments</p>
<p>After few months the question came naturally to me: &ldquo;How much fun would it be to work with these amazing technologies in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After a lot of reading, practice, typing, I got a couple of certification and in the beginning of 2021 I was starting my first job in the operations of a Fintech company. Wow!!</p>
<p>However, true love was about to strike. While working, I started to explore the intimidating, it was for me at that time, world of coding languages. With reverence mixed to doubt I approached Python.</p>
<p>It was not love at first sight. I took me some dedication to overcome the steep beginners learning curve. Once got at the top of the hill a beautiful landscape of loops, variables, if statements, classes, etc&hellip; was waiting for me.</p>
<p>Java followed Python and many framwork with it. I left my job in operation, focussed on studies and at the beginning of 2022 I was starting a new adventure in the world of professional Software Engineer.</p>
