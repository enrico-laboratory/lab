      <description>My path to Software Engineering It was March 2020. I was enjoying my growing career as a professional musician, choir conductor. Suddenly all my rehearsals were cancelled and all my concerts &amp;ldquo;rescheduled&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Two or three month and I will be back to my music&amp;rdquo; I told myself. At that time I could not suspect that a new career was waiting for me.
March 2020, could not work and a lot of &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo;.</description>
